Note: Probably best to delete this file when your done reading it

Step 1:
Enter the folder labled php. Once in this folder open up the file named config.php

Step 2:
Edit the variables to your database info. For example:

$hostname = "localhost";
$hostname is simply the url for the database host

$username = "root";
$username is the username that you use to access the database

$password = "123";
$password is the password that you used to access the database

$database = "Minecraft";
$database is the database in which you will be using. A lot of times it's named Minecraft but it could be different!

MAKE SURE THERE ARE STILL QUOTES AROUND THE INFO!

If you want to alter the top logo, I will let you do that and it's located at :

As per the license you are not allowed to alter the website, but altering the logo will be allowed.
Of course you may want to personalize it, so simply ask me in the comments or via PM if it's cool to alter it.

Or I mean don't, not like I'm going to sue you but please at least retain some credits!
